des

`des` (DAO Execution System) is a DAO contract-set that tokenizes
proposals into `ERC721` tokens and allows for arbitrary execution from
an admin contract.

The `Runtime` contract can execute both transcation batches and
contracts deployments using the `create` and `create2` opcodes. Every
transaction batch also includes a message that is emitted as an event
when executed.

By abstracting proposals into `ERC721` tokens, the logic is also
factored out from the controller/governor/registry contract and enables
upgradeability for more expressive proposal formats if desired (for
example, a multi-choice proposal).

Proposals start out as `draft`s and can then be staged by the owner or
accounts with nft approval. When staged, anyone with enough token votes
can `open` the proposal for voting. We believe the proposal lifecycle
and staging/unstaging methodology should improve the feedback process
between the proposer(s) and the DAO members/participants.
